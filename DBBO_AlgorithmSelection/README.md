# DBBO_AlgorithmSelection
Algorithm Selection for discrete  Black-Box optimization

# Usage

Run `python3 EPM/Main.py`

By default all features will be used in model training, but you can specify

`--n_features N` i.e. `--n_features 29`

to use only `N` features

There are 29 features from flacco and 50 overall, so if you want to compare flacco and flacco+paradiseo results, you should compare 29 vs 50 features
